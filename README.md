## Design

### Database

To start the database, make sure you follow these steps:

1. Clone the project.
2. Download binaries as zip from https://www.enterprisedb.com/download-postgresql-binaries
3. Unzip and Copy their content to the "postgre" folder.
4. You should now have 3 batch-files and a folder named "pgsql" inside the postgre folder.
5. Now you should be able to start the database by running the "start_db.cmd" file
6. After successfully starting the database, you can import all tables by running the "import_db.cmd" file while the database is running.
